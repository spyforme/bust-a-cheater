# My Boyfriend Cheated on Me. What Do I Do?

Relationships can be complicated, and dealing with betrayal can be detrimental to one’s emotional and mental state. Sometimes, a disloyal or toxic relationship can make you resort to physical harm, but all of this is not necessary. You need to think about the situation long and hard without being influenced by your emotions. This is probably the best way to figure things out between you and your partner. Here are 5 things you can do once you find out your boyfriend is cheating. 

## 1. Talk to Yourself
This is probably the most important step. You need to ask yourself if you can truly forgive him for what he has done. While you are at it, look for ways that this could have been avoided. Was there something lacking in your relationship? Has he been forced to continue this all along? Are you two really made for each other? Does this mistake dwarf your relationship? These are a few questions that you are likely to come across. Find a solution to each one, as it will help you deal with the situation. 

## 2. Talk to Him
You must open a conversation with him and have him explain his behavior to you. Communication gaps can hurt relationships, and sometimes not being given the opportunity to talk can end up bad for both parties. Confront him and let him know what you have felt and how you have been dealing with this. Likewise, allow him to spill it all out. Don’t let aggression take over the situation as it always ends badly. You have every right to get mad, but try to talk to him calmly.

## 3. Take Some Time Off
Once you take a break from the toxic relationship, you might realize just how important it is for you to either keep him close or simply let it all go. When your emotions are not as heightened as they had been, you’ll be able to look for a solution with improved focus and a relaxed mindset. 

Jumping to rash decisions can become a source of regret later, so give yourself some time off, think about this and then make a decision. 

## 4. Rebuild Trust If Possible

If he is worth fighting for, try and rebuild trust. You can do so in the same way trust had been built in the first place. This is only possible if you are both willing to forget and forgive and aim for improvement. Establish ground rules if necessary and let him know just how much you’d be disappointed if he broke them again. Do not expect things to go back to normal just yet as wounds take some time to heal.

However, only opt for this option if you are sure you can move past this. You have just been betrayed in the cruelest way possible, and it’s perfectly understandable if you want to end things.

## 5. Consider All Alternatives

In a relationship, treachery is probably the worst thing a partner can do to you, so you need to consider all options with an open mind. Don’t let your emotions influence you into giving someone another chance when he does not clearly deserve it. Think through and take a break, break up or give him another chance. 

Make sure this process leads you to self-healing. A broken heart is not very easy to mend. Self-heal, mature and grow out of it if need be.
